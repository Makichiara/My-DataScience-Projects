**Master in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Projects**

Welcome to my repository! This space collects a series of projects that me and my working team have developed during our academic journey, addressing various relevant topics in the fields of data science and artificial intelligence.

**Description**

In this repository, you will find the main projects developed by us, with the goal of applying the theoretical knowledge acquired during the master's program to practical and real-world scenarios. Each project is accompanied by a detailed description, code documentation, and analysis of the results.
All projects and their documentation are in Italian. The programming languages used are primarily R and Python.

**Objectives**

*Practical Application:* Develop concrete solutions to real-world problems using advanced Data Science and AI techniques.
*Collaboration:* Work in teams to combine diverse skills and perspectives, enhancing the quality and innovation of the projects.
*Knowledge Sharing:* Share the know-how and experiences gained during the master's program to contribute to the growth of the scientific and technological community.

**Projects**

*1. Premi Nobel: Esplorazione nello spazio e nel tempo:* Exploratory analysis on an open-source dataset containing Nobel Prize winners from 1901 onwards.

*2.Fashon MNIST Dataset:* Multiclass classification using the Fashion MNIST dataset, which involves classifying clothing items based on image recognition using neural networks.

*3.Sviluppo di un Software per la Gestione delle Emissioni di Pagamento dell'IRAP:* Development of a software application designed to manage the issuance and processing of IRAP (Regional Tax on Productive Activities) payments.


**Note:** The new projects will be progressively updated.
