**Master in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Projects**

Welcome to my repository! This space collects a series of projects that me and my working team have developed during our academic journey, addressing various relevant topics in the fields of data science and artificial intelligence.

**Description**

In this repository, you will find the main projects developed by us, with the goal of applying the theoretical knowledge acquired during the master's program to practical and real-world scenarios. Each project is accompanied by a detailed description, code documentation, and analysis of the results.
All projects and their documentation are in Italian. The programming languages used are primarily R and Python.

**Objectives**

*Practical Application:* Develop concrete solutions to real-world problems using advanced Data Science and AI techniques.
*Collaboration:* Work in teams to combine diverse skills and perspectives, enhancing the quality and innovation of the projects.
*Knowledge Sharing:* Share the know-how and experiences gained during the master's program to contribute to the growth of the scientific and technological community.

**Projects**

*- Premi Nobel: Esplorazione nello spazio e nel tempo:* Exploratory analysis on an open-source dataset containing Nobel Prize winners from 1901 onwards.

*- Siti patrimonio dell'Unesco:* a detailed analysis of UNESCO World Heritage Sites using Python's pandas library. It includes data preparation, exploratory analysis, and geospatial visualization to uncover patterns in the distribution and categorization of these globally significant sites. 

*- Fashion MNIST Dataset:* Multiclass classification using the Fashion MNIST dataset, which involves classifying clothing items based on image recognition using neural networks.

*- Sviluppo di un Software per la Gestione delle Emissioni di Pagamento dell'IRAP:* Development of a software application (OOP) designed to manage the issuance and processing of IRAP (Regional Tax on Productive Activities) payments.

*- (Deep Learning) Colon-rectal histology image classification:* Multiclass classification using images of colon-rectal images including a data augmentation level. 

*- Analisi sulla qualità dell'acqua:* Analysis of a classification problem based on the study of chemical properties of water using decision trees, Random Forest and Boosting.

*- Previsione a 10 anni dello spopolamento delle città italiane:* Investigation of the main features that could result in the depopulation of municipalities in 10 years,
starting from selected areas of an Italian government initiative, the National Strategy for Inner Areas (SNAI). (Algorithms: Random Forest, Elastic Search, Neural Network and Gradient Boosting Machine, using different methods of sampling, feature importance analysis and partial plots).

*- Clustering sull'olio d' oliva italiano:* Using the chemical and physical properties of Italian olive oil to determine their provenance in Italian regions (K-Means, K-Medods, agglomerative methods, LDA, GMM)






**Note:** The new projects will be progressively updated.
